Technical operations lead, in charge of the infrastructure (mostly AWS based) overall stability and scalability. Responsible for the constant improvement of transparency and visibility (via logging and monitoring), and maintainability of the platform (via config management/automation).

I took over all the things operations and gradually worked to introduce new tools and practices following the DevOps principles. Upgraded config management from internally developed Bash-based system to a Puppet-based one. Added visibility and telemetry with Zenoss Core and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

The above effort enabled the infrastructure to sustain a fast grow that eventually brought us to the _1 million users_ target and above.
