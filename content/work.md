- #### Special Circumstances Ltd

  January 2017 - current

  Freelancer

  I founded _Special Circumstances_ to be free to offer the best of the expertise I gathered so far in my career, anywhere, to any firm in the world.

  _Special Circumstances_ coaches and supports teams and firms on a wide variety of important tasks that constantly challenge the modern IT industry, like:

  - choose right tools and Cloud providers
  - _how to migrate from/to the Cloud_ strategies
  - _Infrastructure as Code_ setup and refactoring
  - extend system automation to free operators from toil
  - gather visibility over KPIs through telemetry
  - unit + integration + E2E test and code review workflows via Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipelines
  - Serverless architectures and dev environment (local and remote) setups
  - _SPA_ applications leveraging modern technologies like reactive/responsive web frameworks and JAMStack
  - planning and execution of deliverable (_build_) deploys, dataset migrations, middleware major version upgrades, etc.
  - _Monolith vs. Micro-services_ strategy analysis
  - (virtual) network layout design
  - ...and more

  Keeping everything secure and usable by both end users _and_ operators is our most dear core value.

- #### Bonial International GmbH, Berlin (Germany)

  July 2013 - December 2016

  Senior System Engineer

  Bonial, multinational business in the publishing field, was looking for someone willing to embrace the challenge of refactoring their relatively big Puppet codebase, all while expanding their operations. I was eager to get onboard and test my skills on a new scale (thousand of servers).

  I happily joined the _Operations_ team as team lead and put in charge of the overall infrastructure stability, robustness and maintainability, enforcing best operational practices.

  In my years at Bonial I witnessed first hand the IT department and especially the Operations team exponential growth. We regularly faced interesting new challenges, some of them planned, like cloud providers migrations (from Rackspace to AWS), some of them unexpected and frantic, like embracing the new micro-services paradigm, which in itself put an incredible amount of new goals and responsibilities on my team.

  As the _new way_ took off more and more, we gradually abandoned self managed hosts (and Puppet with them) moving towards cloud services. Terraform was our tool of choice to help us manage at best our multi-account, multi-region AWS setup. We decided to implement internally our Terraform orchestrator to better integrate with our CI/CD pipeline, react to failures, and enforce good coding practices.
