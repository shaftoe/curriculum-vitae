Soon after my discovery of GNU/Linux, sometime around 1996, my life changed dramatically, with Open Source software becaming something between a passion and a de-facto obsession. I still remember the sweat and long hours reading the little and sometimes exoteric documentation I had, trying to get an ADSL modem work. The elation once I first saw a web page displaying on my desktop (at that time I was running some Linux flavour called _Mandrake_) is still vivid in my memory, for the young me that was an intellectually very satisfying feat and, well, hooked me for good.

During my early twenties at engineering university I managed to complete the first theoretical exams but, as soon as I got my hands dirty with real projects, I felt the strong need to drop out and pursue some more _concrete_ kind of work.

Since then I've travelled the planet far and abroad, assuming each time different roles in the Information Technology industry, both as a freelancer and as part of a team. After inception as Junior Linux System Administrator, I went from _system engineer_ to _devops engineer_ to _site reliability engineer_ to... who knows what else the future will bring.

With each new role name failing to properly define the actual day-to-day work, I since long preferred to say _"I work in Operations"_ which seemed to satisfy most of the people in the field, but still left me somehow unsatisfied. The past 20 years brought some sensible advances in the way of work, bringing in powerful methodologies and tools from the broad dev community, design patterns, code testing, code revies, revision control, to name only a few.

At some point while [automating all the things](http://www.anchor.com.au/blog/2011/08/automate-all-the-things/), I suddently realized my mental barrier between Dev and Ops was broken, hence embracing the early Devops movement with enthusiasm. While learning the core values, adopting the tools and methodologies and, most importantly, putting them in practice every working day, once in a while I found the chance to attend the DevOps conferences, representing to me the best moments still to exchange ideas _live_ with other tech peers. With [Puppet](https://puppet), the Config Management System ubiquitous in those years, was love at first script, it quickly helped me to manage configuration complexity, boosted productivity and gave me confidence while managing server fleets of increasing magnitudes.
