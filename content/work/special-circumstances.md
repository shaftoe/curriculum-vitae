I founded _Special Circumstances_ to be free to offer the best of the expertise I gathered so far in my career, anywhere, to any firm in the world.

_Special Circumstances_ coaches and supports teams and firms on a wide variety of important tasks that constantly challenge the modern IT industry, like:

- choose right tools and Cloud providers
- _how to migrate from/to the Cloud_ strategies
- _Infrastructure as Code_ setup and refactoring
- extend system automation to free operators from toil
- gather visibility over KPIs through telemetry
- unit + integration + E2E test and code review workflows via Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipelines
- Serverless architectures and dev environment (local and remote) setups
- _SPA_ applications leveraging modern technologies like reactive/responsive web frameworks and JAMStack
- planning and execution of deliverable (_build_) deploys, dataset migrations, middleware major version upgrades, etc.
- _Monolith vs. Micro-services_ strategy analysis
- (virtual) network layout design
- ...and more

Keeping everything secure and usable by both end users _and_ operators is our most dear core value.
